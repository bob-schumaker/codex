# Progress

## Working

- Codex-side local-controller metadata now publishes enough launch information
  for controller discovery, including process ID, endpoint URI, nonce, and
  `mainThreadId` once available.
- The design preserves the TUI as primary input owner while allowing an approved
  controller to acquire and release control.
- The spec corpus now states that controller discovery uses
  `$CODEX_HOME/local-controllers`, not generic Codex hooks or Herdr metadata.
- In-process local-controller socket coverage now exercises the native TUI
  approval path rather than durable enrollment test credentials.
- External-controller admission now extracts exact main-thread targets from the
  admitted normal app-server interface, including serialized thread mutations
  and concurrent read methods.
- Thread-scoped TUI-only mutations now reclaim primary input ownership from an
  active controller lease before dispatch.
- Focused app-server controller tests pass. The full app-server suite still
  shows intermittent zsh-fork timeout failures under full-suite load; the
  affected tests pass when rerun individually.

## In Flight

- Downstream controller-host discovery and display behavior for all live Codex
  launches, including non-Herdr launches.

## Remaining

- Downstream controller host should discover all live launches through
  local-controller metadata watching/rescanning.
- Downstream display should separate:
  - launch liveness,
  - participation/authorization state,
  - active input ownership, and
  - product slot assignment.
- Downstream auto-assignment should preserve explicit slots and fill free slots
  deterministically for newly discovered live launches.

## Risks or Follow-ups

- A controller product that gates visibility on Herdr `agent_session` can hide
  valid Codex launches.
- A product that maps "not approved" or "not active owner" to offline will
  misrepresent live Codex sessions.
- The implementation plan must continue to avoid durable enrollment or reusable
  controller credentials unless a future design explicitly changes that
  decision.
- Keep Codex native local-controller tests on the TUI approval path so stale
  credential-enrollment assumptions do not mask launch behavior regressions.
- Keep controller admission and target-extraction tables aligned when opening
  additional normal app-server methods to approved controllers.
